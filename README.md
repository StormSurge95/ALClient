**NOTE: This code is very much a work in progress. Things will quickly change, and your code will likely break between changes.**

This is a node client for the game [Adventure Land - The Code MMORPG](https://adventure.land). It's 99% custom code that seems *much* more efficient than running the code in-game, or using the game's official CLI.

This code is **NOT** a 1-to-1 drop in, like [ALBot](https://github.com/NexusNull/ALBot) aims to be. The code that you run in the console in game **WILL NOT** run as-is if you try to run it using this project.

# Requirements
* Node
    * Tested with **14.13.1**

# Installation
TODO: Updated installation using `npm install`.
